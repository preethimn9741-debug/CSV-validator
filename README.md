# CSV Data Validator

## 📌 Project Description
**CSV Data Validator** is a Python-based command-line tool that validates CSV files against configurable rules.
It checks for missing or incorrect columns, invalid values, incorrect data types, and formatting issues, then generates a detailed error report.

This project is built as a **learning and practice tool** to understand data quality validation and data cleaning workflows commonly used in data engineering.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project is:
- ✅ A learning exercise  
- ✅ A reusable CSV validation utility  
- ❌ Not a production-grade validation framework  

It helps ensure CSV data meets expected quality standards before further processing.
